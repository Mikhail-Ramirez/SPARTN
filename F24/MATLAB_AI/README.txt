To run properly, put AudioDataset folder in same folder as BinaryDroneAi.m
(currently uploaded to group google drive, Drone Detection/Audio Datasets/DroneAudioDataset/Binary_Drone_Audio/BinaryDroneAudioAI_dataset/AudioDataset)

MATLAB needs to have Audio Toolbox, Parallel Computing Toolbox, and Deep Learning Toolbox add-ons installed.

Training is currently set to run on a GPU, to change this to suit your PC's needs, update the ExecutionEnvironment variable in trainingOptions.
