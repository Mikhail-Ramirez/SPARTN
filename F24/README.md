# Project description
Drone technology has been rapidly expanding and proliferating, and its application in warfare has led to a disruption in both civilian airspace and battlefields. Geofencing has failed to adequately combat this, which has allowed drones to freely enter restricted airspace areas, such as airports and major public events. Being able to detect drones early and identify them as either friendly or hostile can help reduce civilian casualties and prevent accidentally destroying friendly drones. To achieve this, we are implementing a distributed sensor network that detects drones utilizing radio frequencies and acoustic signals. This network will be able to report the exact position of drones in 3D space in real time to users using an Android tablet application, and will also be able to differentiate between friendly drones and enemy drones.
