TDOA Analysis Script for a Continuous Square/Sawtooth Wave

This script:
  1. Records audio from 3 microphones simultaneously for 30 seconds.
  2. Saves all raw samples to a CSV file ("recorded_samples.csv").
  3. Splits the recording into short windows (default 0.1 s) and computes the delay 
     (time difference of arrival, TDOA) between Mic4 (reference) and the other two mics using cross-correlation.
  4. Saves the computed TDOA data to a CSV file ("tdoa_delays.csv") and plots the delays over time.
  5. Computes and prints the average delay and percent error for Mic2 and Mic3 relative to Mic4.
  
Enjoy the script that listens for 30 seconds so you can finally judge whether your mics are "in sync"‚Äîor just wildly off-beat!
