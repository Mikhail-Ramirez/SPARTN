TDOA Analysis Script for a Continuous Square/Sawtooth Wave (2-Microphone Version)

This script:
  1. Records audio from 2 microphones simultaneously for 30 seconds.
  2. Saves all raw samples to a CSV file ("recorded_samples.csv").
  3. Splits the recording into short windows (default 0.1 s) and computes the delay
     (time difference of arrival, TDOA) between Mic4 (reference) and Mic3 using cross-correlation.
  4. Saves the computed TDOA data to a CSV file ("tdoa_delays.csv") and plots the delay over time.
  5. Computes and prints the average delay and percent error for Mic3 relative to Mic4.

Listen up‚Äîthis script records 30 seconds so you can see if your mics are in sync or if one‚Äôs dancing to its own beat!
